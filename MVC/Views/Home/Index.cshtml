            <h3>Professional Background</h3>
            <p>
                I’m an experienced backend developer worked primarily with PHP in enterprise environments, adhering strictly to SOLID principles, Domain-Driven Design, and Martin Fowler’s architectural patterns.
                My day-to-day work involved maintaining and refactoring large-scale web applications, where clean architecture and long-term maintainability are essential.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also work with C#/.NET in both backend APIs and MVC projects, and I'm deeply familiar with layered architecture, dependency injection, and repository/unit-of-work patterns.

            <h3>Education</h3>
            <p>
                I earned my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science at <strong>FIT VUT</strong> (Brno University of Technology).
                My bachelor’s thesis involved the development of a RPGs game with a procedurally generated elements using Unity Game engine. This project was presented at an exhibition in Brno that focused on raising awareness of student game development (https://hernikompas.cz/).

            </p>
            <p>
                I continued with a Master's degree in the specialization <strong>Development and Design of Software Systems</strong> at <strong>FI MUNI</strong> (Masaryk University). My master's thesis focused on refactoring the internal chat module of the LiveAgent software, applying Domain-Driven Design and SOLID principles to modernize a critical legacy subsystem.

            <h3>Game Development</h3>
            <p>
                In my free time, I explore game development using Unity. I focus on 2D mechanics and procedural content generation, building on my bachelor’s thesis about generating procedurally created RPGs. 
                These projects allow me to work with Unity’s scripting, level generation algorithms, and performance tuning techniques.
            </p>
            <p>
                I use this playground to apply clean architecture principles even in Unity contexts — implementing custom ECS patterns, behavior trees, and modular level systems.

            <h3>Personal Traits</h3>
            <p>
                I’m driven by software quality and maintainability. I value clear architecture, continuous learning, and practical use of theory. 
                I enjoy taking
